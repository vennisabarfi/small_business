# Inventory Management System with Advanced Analytics

## Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive Inventory Management System built with Go for the backend and PostgreSQL for data storage. It includes user authentication, product management, stock management, supplier management, and sales order management. Additionally, Python and AI functionalities are integrated to provide advanced analytics and reporting features, offering insights into inventory trends and sales performance.

## Goals
- Provide a robust backend for managing inventory, suppliers, and sales orders.
- Implement secure user authentication and authorization.
- Integrate advanced analytics using Python and AI to provide insights into inventory trends and sales performance.
- Ensure high code quality with comprehensive testing and modern development practices.

- [ ] Create `Supplier` model and migration.
- [ ] Write tests for supplier management endpoints.

### Day 9: Sales Order Management

### Day 10: Advanced Analytics Setup
- [ ] Set up Python environment and integrate it with the Go backend.
- [ ] Create a basic analytics service using Python.
- [ ] Implement a script to fetch data from PostgreSQL and perform basic analysis.

### Day 11-12: Implement AI and Advanced Analytics
- [ ] Use AI/ML libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, pandas) to develop models for inventory trend analysis.
- [ ] Implement endpoints to fetch analytics data (`/api/analytics/inventory
-trends`, `/api/analytics/sales-performance`).
- [ ] Develop visualizations and reports using libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn.
- [ ] Create endpoints to serve these visualizations and reports (`/api/reports/inventory-trends`, `/api/reports/sales-performance`).

### Day 13: Documentation and API Specifications
- [ ] Write comprehensive documentation for all endpoints.
- [ ] Implement API specification using Swagger/OpenAPI.
- [ ] Add examples and usage instructions in the README.

### Day 14: Testing and Quality Assurance
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests to ensure code quality.
- [ ] Achieve at least 90% test coverage.
- [ ] Perform load testing to ensure scalability and performance.

### Day 15: Deployment and CI/CD
- [ ] Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or another CI/CD tool.
- [ ] Configure deployment scripts and ensure smooth deployment to a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure).
- [ ] Conduct final testing and validation in the production environment.
